# crypto-challenges
My attempt at the Matasano crypto challenges which can be found [here](http://cryptopals.com/).       
I have decided to use Python.
Note: Each file is meant to be run separately as its own program, but they a few depend on each other, so make sure they are all in the same directory when you run one of them.
